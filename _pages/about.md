I work on video understanding, continual learning, and robust anomaly detection—bridging research and production for high-scale systems.
Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (University of South Florida). I care about methods that survive distribution shift, limited labels, and
production constraints.

## Research interests

- Video understanding & long-horizon representation learning
- Continual learning and adaptation under drift
- Robust anomaly detection (statistical + deep)
- Evaluation, reliability, and deployment trade-offs

## Awards

- CVPR 2021 Continual Learning Challenge – 1st place
- CVPR 2021 Outstanding Reviewer
- NIST Automated Streams Analysis Challenge – Winner
- AI City Challenge 2020 – 2nd place
